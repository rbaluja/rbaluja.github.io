Welcome!  

I am an environmental economist with research interests in industrial organization and labor economics. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Arizona. Prior to joining the University of Arizona, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics from the University of California, San Diego.
