Welcome!  

I am an associate at Cornerstone Research, Los Angeles. I (very) recently received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Arizona. Prior to joining Arizona, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics from the University of California, San Diego.

You can contact me at RobertBaluja at gmail.
