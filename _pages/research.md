<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b> (Job Market Paper)
<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: To understand the effectiveness of migration in limiting exposure to
future climate damages, I specify and estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of
migration within Mexico. I combine this with a non-stationary and
spatially-varying model of the climate, of which I allow for both fully-informed
and naive expectations of the future progression. Estimation of the model uses a
sample of life histories, covering the years 1950-2019, and follows a nested
full-solution pseudo-maximum likelihood routine. I find that predicted warming
under a business-as-usual climate scenario will lead to an increase in the value
placed on the ability to migrate domestically of 70% across a single
generation. I also use the model to understand the value of information on the
climate system. I find that climate-naive individuals stand to gain an average
of $1,105 over their lifetime from obtaining correct information on the
business-as-usual climate transition to aid in their adaptation decisions. This
has important policy implications for the design of information campaigns to aid
in climate adaptation. I further use the model to understand the different
incentives that are created by the dynamic structure of policy. I find that the option value, from non-migrants, of a dynamically-available $100 reduction in moving costs increases by 15% between the 2020 and 2038 cohorts, under business-as-usual warming.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
