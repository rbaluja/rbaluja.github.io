<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b> (Job Market Paper)
<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: To understand the effectiveness of migration in limiting exposure to
future climate damages, I specify and estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of
migration within Mexico. I combine the lifecycle model with a non-stationary
model of the climate which varies throughout the country, and I allow for
individuals to form either sophisticated or naive expectations of its future
progression. Estimation of the model uses a sample of life histories,
covering the years 1950-2019, and follows a nested full-solution pseudo-maximum
likelihood routine. I combine the estimated model with full-count census data to
simulate forward population movements through 2080 under a variety of
counterfactual scenarios. First, I find that predicted warming under a
business-as-usual climate scenario will lead to an increase in the value of
the ability to migrate of over 69% across a single age generation. Moreover, the ability to migrate domestically reduces expected lifetime
climate damages. This reduction is increasing in the degree of warming:
today's young adults face 28% lower lifetime climate damages because of their
ability to migrate whereas today's infants face 33% lower lifetime damages from
the same. I further use the model to understand the different incentives that
are created by the dynamic structure of policy. Policies which seek to encourage
actions that are costly, infrequently chosen, and available more than once, can
deliver substantial welfare benefits when designed appropriately.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
