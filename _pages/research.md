<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b>  
  <p>Abstract: Climate change will lead to large changes in global weather patterns and extreme
  events. The damages from such changes will be spatially heterogeneous, implying
  that migration can be a valuable form of adaptation. Its
  value and responsiveness to different policy levers are open
  empirical questions. To provide answers, I specify and estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of
  migration within Mexico, with individuals aware of a non-stationary and spatially heterogeneous climate. Estimation
  makes use of a rich sample of life histories, covering the years 1950-2019,
  and follows a nested full-solution pseudo-maximum likelihood
  routine. I combine the estimated model with full-count census data to simulate
 forward population movements through 2038 under a variety of counterfactual scenarios. Under
  business-as-usual, I find that
  migration reduces climate damages in Mexico by 29%, with large heterogeneity
  across space. I further find that migration rates are highly responsive to
  reductions in their costs: a permanent 1% such decrease leads to an
  increase in migration rates of around 5.4%. Similarly, I find that a one-time moving subsidy of
  $200, to be used at any point in the life-cycle, generates $1.6 billion in
  net welfare gains, with much of the value coming from the option value of
  never-movers. This highlights the importance of considering the dynamic option
  value of future opportunities when designing policy to aid costly adaptation.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> (Submitted) - with [Bo Guo](https://guolab.arizona.edu), [Wesley Howden](http://wesleyhowden.com), [Ashley Langer](https://www.ashleylanger.com), [Derek Lemoine](https://www.dereklemoine.com)  
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
