<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: Earth's climate is changing, which is widely expected to drive net reductions to human welfare. In this paper, I study how effectively migration will reduce experienced climate damages. To provide answers to my research questions, I
develop and estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of migration within Mexico. I
combine this with a non-stationary and spatially varying model of the climate,
in which I allow for both fully informed and naive expectations of the future
progression of climate change. Estimation of the climate model uses daily-level
historical weather data and output from state-of-the-art climate simulations.
Estimation of the lifecycle model uses a sample of life histories, covering the
years 1950-2019, and follows a nested full solution pseudo-maximum likelihood
routine. I find that climate damages from business-as-usual warming would be 28%
higher if domestic migration within Mexico was no longer available as a tool of
adaptation to climate change. Moreover, the fraction of the population that I estimate as
forming naive expectations of the climate system would experience an average of
2% less lifetime climate damages from becoming fully informed on
the climate transition. Given that most of the increased damages this population faces
come from a reduced propensity to migrate, one way to reduce these losses is to
subsidize migration. I find that subsidizing migration at the average level of the internality reduces their welfare losses by
8-19%. The exact value of this reduction depends on whether the policy forces people to use the subsidy in a particular period. Policies that allow individuals to choose <i>when</i> to use them are over twice as valuable to the affected population because they do not overly incentivize dynamically suboptimal moves. This sort of policy is common; examples include provisions from the recent Inflation Reduction Act and first-time homeowners tax credits.</p>

<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
