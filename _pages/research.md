<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b> (JMP)
<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: Climate change will lead to large changes in global weather patterns and extreme
events. The damages from such changes will be spatially heterogeneous, implying
that migration can be a valuable form of adaptation. Its value and responsiveness
to different policy levers are open empirical questions. To provide answers, I specify
and estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of migration within Mexico. I combine the
life-cycle model with a non-stationary and spatially heterogeneous model of the climate,
and allow for both myopic and fully informed and rational expectations of its future
progression. Estimation makes use of a rich sample of life histories, covering the years
1950–2019, and follows a nested full-solution pseudo-maximum likelihood routine. I
combine the estimated model with full-count census data to simulate forward population
movements through 2038 under a variety of counterfactual scenarios. These simulations
highlight the importance of migration in limiting the damages of climate change. First,
I find that predicted warming under a business-as-usual climate scenario will cause the
lifetime value of migration, for the average young man in Mexico, to increase by over
80% by 2038. Similarly, I find that the ability to migrate reduces expected lifetime
climate damages for this same group by 36%, with this reduction increasing to 48% by
2038. I conclude by using the model to understand the welfare implications of various
migration subsidy schemes. I find that any policy that exploits the option value of
future opportunities induces large net welfare improvements.</p>

  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
