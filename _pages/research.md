<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: Climate change will continue to cause large-scale changes to global
weather patterns and extreme events. Migration has the potential to be a
powerful limiting force against the damages from such changes to the climate.
Indeed, I find that climate damages from business-as-usual warming would be 28%
higher if domestic migration within Mexico was no longer available as a tool of
adaptation to climate change.  Our ability to appropriately and dynamically
adapt to the damages from climate change relies on our ability to correctly
anticipate future warming. The fraction of the population that I estimate as
forming naive expectations of the climate system would experience an average of
2% fewer climate damages over their lifetime if they were to become fully-informed on
the climate transition. Given that much of the increased damages faced by this population
come from a reduced propensity to migrate, one way to reduce these losses is to
subsidize migration. I find that subsidizing migration at the value to the
climate-naive from becoming fully-informed reduces their welfare losses by
8-19%, depending on the dynamic structure of the policy. The difference in the
effectiveness of different policy options is driven by the value one places on the
ability to move in the future at a reduced cost. This option value is positive
for dynamically-available policies; is increasing in future warming for the
fully-informed, but not the climate-naive; and causes dynamically-available
policies to positively select from the portion of the population marginal to a
static reduction of moving costs. To provide answers to my research questions, I
develop and estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of migration within Mexico. I
combine this with a non-stationary and spatially-varying model of the climate,
in which I allow for both fully-informed and naive expectations of the future
progression of climate change. Estimation of the climate model uses daily-level
historical weather data and output from high-quality climate simulations.
Estimation of the lifecycle model uses a sample of life histories, covering the
years 1950-2019, and follows a nested full solution pseudo-maximum likelihood
routine.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
