<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b> (Job Market Paper)
<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: Climate change will continue to cause large-scale changes to global weather patterns and extreme events. To understand the effectiveness of migration in limiting exposure to future climate damages, I specify and
  estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of migration within Mexico. I combine this with a non-stationary and
  spatially-varying model of the climate, of which I allow for both fully-informed and naive expectations of the
  future progression. Estimation of the model uses a sample of life histories, covering the years 1950-2019,
  and follows a nested full-solution pseudo-maximum likelihood routine. I find that predicted warming under a
  business-as-usual climate scenario will lead to an increase in the value placed on the ability to migrate
  domestically of 70% across a single generation. I also use the model to understand the value of information
  on the climate system in aiding adaptation to climate change. I find that the value of migration would increase by 5%, for the climate-naive, if they become informed on the climate transition. I further use the model to understand the different incentives that are created by the
  dynamic structure of policy. I find that dynamic reductions to moving costs induce positive selection from the portion of the population marginal to moving. Warming will diminish the relative benefits of such dynamic policy. This finding is generalizable to settings where policymakers seek to induce costly and long-lasting behaviors.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
