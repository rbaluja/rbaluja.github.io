<b>Escape the Heat: The Dynamics of Migration as Adaptation to Climate Change</b> (Job Market Paper)
<br style="line-height: 5px" />
  <p>Abstract: Climate change will continue to cause large-scale changes to global weather patterns and extreme events. Migration has the potential to be a powerful limiting force against the damages of such changes to the climate. Indeed, I find that predicted warming under a
business-as-usual climate scenario will lead to an increase in the value placed on the ability to migrate
domestically within Mexico of 70% across a single generation. Our ability to appropriately and dynamically adapt to the damages of climate change relies on our ability to correctly anticipate future warming. I recover large returns to the fraction of the population that I estimate as forming naive expectations of the climate from becoming informed on the climate system: the value of their domestic migration would increase by 5% from obtaining and using such information. I highlight that one way to reduce this value is through subsidizing migration. I find that reasonable subsidies reduce the welfare-losses of the climate-naive by 8-18% of the subsidy value, depending on the dynamic structure of the policy. This difference is, in part, driven by my finding that dynamic reductions to moving costs induce positive selection from the portion of the population marginal to moving. I highlight that this finding is generalizable to settings where policymakers seek to induce costly and long-lasting behaviors in a non-stationary environment. To provide answers to my research questions, I design and
estimate a dynamic lifecycle model of migration within Mexico. I combine this with a non-stationary and
spatially-varying model of the climate, in which I allow for both fully-informed and naive expectations of the
future progression of climate change. Estimation of the model uses a sample of life histories, covering the years 1950-2019,
and follows a nested full-solution pseudo-maximum likelihood routine.</p>
<b>PFAS-Contaminated Drinking Water Harms Infants</b> - with Bo Guo, Wesley Howden, Ashley Langer, Derek Lemoine
<br style="line-height: 5px" /> In revision for <i>Science </i>
  <p>Abstract: There is evidence of widespread human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) but limited evidence of human health impacts. Using data on all New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that receiving water that has flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site increases first-year infant mortality by 161% [95% CI: 70–251%], the chance of a birth before 28 weeks of gestational age by 120% [95% CI: 30–210%], and the chance of birthweight below 1,000 g by 152% [95% CI: 48–257%]. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes annual social costs of approximately $8 billion. These health costs are substantially larger than the cost of removing PFAS from the public water supply.</p>
